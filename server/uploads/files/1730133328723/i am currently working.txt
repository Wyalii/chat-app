i am currently working on a chat application designed to facilitate real-time communication between users. This project has allowed me to create my first backend server code, providing valuable experience in building full-stack applications,  I am using Kishan Sheth's youtube videos as a scheme and guide for building this project. His tutorials provide valuable insights and practical examples that help me navigate modern web development practices.
